<h2>Program Reflection & Code:</h2>

- <b>The purpose of my custom python program was to figure out what the most common occurrence of data breaches were between, Financial, Healthcare, and Governmental Organizations. Once that was figured out, the python program was used to find out the most common method used for data breaches in the industry with the most occurrences of data breaches.

- As far as the process goes to my surprise it was fairly simply and I just utilized the top-down planning approach. I think prior to even utilizing the top-down approach the initial challenge was finding the proper data set that I could easily utilize which I ended up getting off of Kaggle. The part that I got stuck on was utilizing the nested if/elif statements. I realized I over did it by calling on an if statement repetitively for the value in the [4] place instead of calling on it once and then nesting the rest of the if statements concerning the values in the [5] place </b>
